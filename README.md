This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Elixir when working with lists and the Enum module.  Modifying a list while iterating over it using `Enum.each` does not have the expected effect because `Enum.each` works with an immutable copy of the list. The solution showcases the correct approach using recursion or other functional techniques to achieve the desired list transformation.
